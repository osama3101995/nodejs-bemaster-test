Development Team Naming Policy Document
Database Naming Conventions:

    Database Names:
        Use descriptive names that reflect the purpose or domain of the database.
        Prefer lowercase with underscores to separate words (e.g., customer_data).

    Table Names:
        Singular nouns for tables (e.g., user, product).
        Use underscores for compound words.

    Column Names:
        Descriptive and concise names.
        Avoid abbreviations; prefer clarity over brevity.

Variable Naming Conventions:

    General Variables:
        Use camelCase for variables (e.g., userName).
        Keep variable names concise and descriptive.

    Constants:
        Uppercase with underscores for constants (e.g., MAX_RETRY_COUNT).

    Boolean Variables:
        Start with "is," "has," or a modal verb (e.g., isActive, hasPermission).

Function Naming Conventions:

    Function Names:
        Use descriptive verbs and nouns.
        Follow camelCase (e.g., calculateTotal, getUserDetails).

    Accessor/Mutator Functions:
        Follow the pattern getPropertyName and setPropertyName for accessor and mutator functions, respectively.

Class Naming Conventions:

    Class Names:
        Use UpperCamelCase (e.g., UserProfile, OrderManager).
        Prefer nouns that represent entities or objects.

    Abstract Classes/Interfaces:
        Prefix with 'Abstract' or use an 'I' prefix for interfaces (e.g., AbstractLogger, ILogger).

Git Naming Conventions:

    Branches:
        Use lowercase, hyphen-separated words (e.g., feature/new-feature, bugfix/fix-issue).

    Commits:
        Begin with a succinct, present-tense verb (e.g., Add, Update, Fix).

    Tags:
        Use semantically versioned tags (e.g., v1.0.0).

File Naming Conventions:

    Source Code Files:
        Descriptive and concise names.
        Use camelCase for JavaScript/TypeScript, snake_case for Python, and PascalCase for C#.

    Config Files:
        Follow a consistent naming pattern (e.g., .env, config.json).

Commenting:

    Code Comments:
        Use clear, concise comments.
        Avoid redundant comments that merely describe what the code is doing.

    Documentation:
        Document APIs and major functions/classes using markdown or a similar standard.

Miscellaneous:

    Acronyms:
        Write acronyms in uppercase (e.g., XMLParser, not XmlParser).

    Consistency:
        Maintain consistent naming patterns across the codebase.

    Code Review Guidelines:
        Reviewers should ensure that the naming conventions are followed during code reviews.
